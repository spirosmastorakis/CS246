Instructions for testing

	1. place the test html and php files (e.g. linechart.html, linechart.php) in the directory in the VM served by Apache Web Server
		e.g. /media/sf_sharedfolder or /var/www (default)
	
	2. update the mysql login credential in "databaseConnect" function found in test php file to your MySQL login credential. (e.g. linechart.php). 
		i.e. $db_connection = mysqli_connect("localhost", "lui", "", $desired_db);

	3. change the $desired_db = "TEST" to the name of the database you created in MySQL. Make sure the Class table is loaded into the aforementioned database. 
	
	4. Make sure MySQL and Apache Web Server is running in the VM via "top" command
	
	5. access the test html in the host OS browser (e.g. Chrome) via forwarded port for the Apache Web Server. 
		e.g. In my case, enter "http://sandbox.dev:8080/CS246/www/linechart.html" in the browser. in this case, "sandbox.dev:8080" is an alias for "localhost:forwarded HTTP port". What followed is the directory from the root of the directory served by Apache Web Server.
